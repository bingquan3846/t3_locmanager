TODO

...a lot

- XML parsing is quite dirty using DOMXML and expat parser. 
- Performance tuning on import
- Better localization overview (Who checked out what when...?)
- Delete files from Localization information after successful import
- Support for updating mechanism (What's new, changes in Pages and Content Elements)
- Support for status handling (Checked out, checked in, proofread, ...)
- How to handle localization of user-specific extension content data not stored in tt_content?
- Code abstraction
- Function indexes
- Support for ACROSS config files
- Readme for localization with PASSOLO 6

-... more to come with further testing
